# COMP90049_A1_K-Nearest-Neighbours
Implemented (by hand) a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier to predict the affordability of cars. KNN is a geometric, supervised learning method which allows us to classify a specific test instance based on the labels of it's closest/nieghbouring instances.

<h4> Completed in August 2022 (Semester 2)</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>knn_classifier.ipynb:</b> The instruction document and my solution combined into 1 jupyter notebook. Solution involves splitting the data, creating distance functions, creating a KNN classifier (both unweighted and weighted), applying the classifier to the dataset, evaluating and analysing the performance of my classifer</li>
  <li><b>car.features:</b> contains 204 instances, one line per instance. The first field is the unique instance identifier. The following fields contain the 24 features, as described in the file car.names</li>
  <li><b>car.labels:</b> contains the gold labels (i.e., one of the four classes above), one instance per line. Again, the first field is the instance identifier, and the second field the instance label.</li>
  <li><b>car.names:</b> contains additional explanations about the data set and the features</li>
